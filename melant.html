      <h3>MêLANT was having trouble working with the limited capability of the CMS, therefore needed a customized solution that wasn't provided in the theme they purchased.
      </h3>
      <h3>To reflect on their minimalistic design, I convinced them that their focus should be on their product. Therefore the user experience should lead customers directly to a purchase.

</br>
    <h3>The Shopify theme MêLANT has been working with came with a video header, which allowed vimeo or youtube video to be embeded.
      However, as the website loaded, the video player was showing the loading process with the video navgation.
      To enhance the user experience, I decided to create a pre-loader to hide the loading video by using preload.js and wrapping the video.

    With just slight variations to the previous accordion menu, I was able to apply a side navigation on the product page to minimalize space for a better user experience.

  <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
</br>
  <h3>
    Collaborating with the marketing director (also the co-founder), I emphasized the importance of search engine optimization as their page or instagram could not be found on the google search engine. Even after the two months of the site's opening,
    all of the traffic was coming from the redirect of their instagram page.</br></br>
    <img src="img/SEO.png" class="design" style="max-width:800px;">
    </br></br>
    <b>THE PROCESS</b></br>
    1. Optimization of the website's loading speed by removing unused assets that were being preloaded that slowed down the website.</br>
    2. Adding the proper alt text on images and checking key words</br>
    3. Linking Instagram for search trust and taking advantage of instagram SEO </br>
    4. Focusing on mobile first</br></br>
    By the time I was able to get their page onto the top search, the website's traffic from google searches increased by atleast <b>25,000%</b> </br></br>
